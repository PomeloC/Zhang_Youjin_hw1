"""
An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using 
all the original letters exactly once. Write a Python program that, when started 1) randomly picks a word w from given list of words,
2) randomly permutes w (thus creating an anagram of w), 3) presents the anagram to the user, and 4) enters an interactive loop
in which the user is invited to guess the original word. It may be a good idea to work with (say) colour words only.
