"""
According to Wikipedia, a semordnilap is a word or phrase that
spells a different word or phrase backwards. ("Semordnilap" is
itself "palindromes" spelled backwards.) Write a semordnilap
recogniser that accepts a file name (pointing to a list of words)
from the user and finds and prints all pairs of words that are
semordnilaps to the screen.
